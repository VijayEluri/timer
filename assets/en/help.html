<p>For a repeating alarm, just set the interval; if the next (i.e. first) alarm is zero, it will be set one interval from now when you click Enable.</p>

<p>For a one-off alarm, set the next alarm as desired and set the interval to zero (which disables further alarms).</p>

<p>Wait for OK will stop the countdown restarting until you acknowledge the alarm.</p>
